Aleph One is the open source continuation of Bungie's Marathon 2 FPS game
engine. Aleph One plays Marathon, Marathon 2, Marathon Infinity, and 3rd-party
content on a wide array of platforms, with (optional) OpenGL rendering,
Internet play, Lua scripting, and more.

The page you're on is of interest to developers of the engine. [Go here instead
if you want to download and play the Marathon Trilogy or one of the many fan
scenarios.](https://alephone.lhowon.org/)
